Created a Linear Regression ML Project to analysis a data set of various pieces of personal information and predicting the costs of charges for medical costs.

Figure 1: Scatterplot with linear fit to show positive correlation between BMI and Medical Costs

Figure 2: Scatterplot with linear fit to show positive correlation between Age and Medical Costs

Figure 3: Correlatoin Matrix to show the strength of correlation between the various continuous variables.

Figure 4: Violin plot to show Medical Cost distributions based on sex.

Figure 5: Violin plot to show Medical Cost distributions based on smoking vs. non-smoking.
